                <p class="web-description">
                        As a Freelance Graphic Designer at Adidas, I had the opportunity to work on various branding projects, 
                        including designing logos for new product lines.
                        In my role as an Art Director at Puma, I successfully led a team in creating brand identities 
                        for multiple marketing campaigns. Most recently, as a Logo Designer at Reebok, 
                        I focused on creating modern and innovative logo designs that captured the essence of the brand.                                    
                        One of my key achievements was designing the logo for a new Adidas sneaker line, which received positive feedback from both customers and industry professionals. This project allowed me to showcase my ability to create a visually appealing and memorable logo that aligned with the brand's identity.
